# Deprecated Documentation - 2025-11-01

## About This Directory

These documentation files were created during the string variable storage and optimization implementation on 2025-10-31 and 2025-11-01. They have been deprecated in favor of the consolidated status document.

For other deprecated documentation, see [../README.md](../README.md).

## Consolidated Location

All information from these documents has been consolidated into:
**[../../status/2025-11-01-string-variable-implementation.md](../../status/2025-11-01-string-variable-implementation.md)**

## Files in This Directory

## Why Deprecated

These files represented incremental documentation created during the implementation process. They have been superseded by a comprehensive consolidated document that provides:
- Better organization
- Clearer narrative flow
- Complete overview of the entire implementation
- Removal of redundancy between documents

## Preservation Reason

These files are preserved for historical reference and to maintain a record of the development process.
