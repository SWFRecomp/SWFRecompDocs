1 Introduction
The Adobe® ActionScript™ Virtual Machine 2, or AVM2 for short, was designed to execute programs written in
the ActionScript 3.0 language. ActionScript 3.0 is based on ECMAScript, the international standardized
programming language for scripting. ActionScript 3.0 is compliant with the ECMAScript Language
Specification, Third Edition (ECMA-262). It also contains functionality based on ongoing work on
ECMAScript Edition 4, occurring within the Ecma International standards body.
This document describes the operation of the AVM2 and defines the file formats, data structures, and
instruction formats used by the AVM2.

1.1

Concepts

The AVM2 was designed to support the ActionScript (AS) 3.0 language, and for the remaining chapters it is
assumed that the reader is aware of the terminology and concepts of the language.
The following vocabulary and associated definitions are taken from the ActionScript 3.0 Language Specification
and are presented only as a review of the material. For full details, refer to the language specification.


Virtual Machine—A virtual machine is a mechanism that takes as its input the description of a
computation and that performs that computation. For the AVM2, the input is in the form of an ABC file,
which contains compiled programs; these comprise constant data, instructions from the AVM2 instruction
set, and various kinds of metadata.



Script—A script set of traits and an initializer method; a script populates a top-level environment with
definitions and data.



Bytecode, code—Bytecode or code is a specification of computation in the form of a sequence of simple
actions on the virtual machine state.



Scope—Scope is a mapping from names to locations, where no two names are the same. Scopes can nest,
and nested scopes can contain bindings (associations between names and locations) that shadow the
bindings of the nesting scope.



Object—An object is an unordered collection of named properties, which are containers that hold values.
A value in ActionScript 3.0 is either an Object reference or one of the special values null or undefined.



Namespace—Namespaces are used to control the visibility of a set of properties independent of the major
structure of the program.



Class—A class is a named description of a group of objects. Objects are created from classes by
instantiation.



Inheritance—New classes can be derived from older classes by the mechanism known as inheritance or
subclassing. The new class is called the derived class or subclass of the old class, and the old class is called the
base class or superclass.



Trait—A trait is a fixed-name property shared by all objects that are instances of the same class; a set of
traits expresses the type of an object.



Method—The word method is used with two separate meanings. One meaning is a method body, which is
an object that contains code as well as data that belong to that code or that describe the code. The other
meaning is a method closure, which is a method body together with a reference to the environment in which
the closure was created. In this document, functions, constructors, ActionScript 3.0 class methods, and
other objects that can be invoked are collectively referred to as method closures.



Verification—The contents of an ABC file undergo verification when the file is loaded into the AVM2.
The ABC file is rejected by the verifier if it does not conform to the AVM2 Overview. Verification is
described in Chapter 3.



Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler—AVM2 implementations may contain an optional run-time compiler for
transforming AVM2 instructions into processor-specific instructions. Although not an implementation
requirement, employing a JIT compiler provides a performance benefit for many applications.

2 The structure of the ActionScript Virtual Machine
2.1

Constant values

The constant values of the AVM2 are one of the following types: int, uint, double, string, namespace,
undefined, or null. The values of these types appear directly in the ABC file or in the instruction encodings.
Important characteristics of these types are:


int—This type is used to represent an integer valued number whose values are 32-bit signed two’s
complement integers. The range of values is from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (-231 to 231-1),
inclusive.



uint—This type is used for integer valued numbers with values that are 32-bit unsigned two’s complement
integers. The range of values is from 0 to 4,294,967,296 (232), inclusive.



double—This type is used for capturing floating point numbers using 64-bit double precision IEEE 754
values as specified in IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic (ANSI/IEEE Standard. 7541985).



string—This type represents a sequence of Unicode characters. Strings are represented in UTF-8 and can
be as long as 230-1 bytes.



namespace—Namespaces tie a URI (represented internally by a string) to a trait. The relationship is
unidirectional, meaning the namespace data type only contains a URI. Each namespace is also of a
particular kind, and there are restrictions regarding the relationships between the trait and kind. These
rules are defined later in this chapter.



null—A singleton value representing “no object”.



undefined—A singleton value representing “no meaningful value”. This constant value is allowed only in
certain contexts.

The AVM2 utilizes several representations for values in its instruction encoding and in the ABC file in order to
provide as compact an encoding as is required.

2.2 Virtual machine overview
Computation in the AVM2 is based on executing the code of a method body in the context of method
information, a local data area, a constant pool, a heap for non-primitive data objects created at run-time, and a
run-time environment. Many data elements are static and are read at startup from an ABC file, whose structure is
defined in Chapter 4.


The code for a method body is composed of instructions, defined in Chapter 5. Each instruction
modifies the state of the machine in some way, or has an effect on the external environment by means
of input or output. 1



The method information determines how the method is used—for example, how default argument
values should be substituted for missing arguments when the method is called.



The local data area for the method consists of the operand stack, the scope stack, and the local registers.

1

In practice, the AVM2 may transform the code at run-time by means of a JIT, but this does not affect the
semantics of execution, only its performance.

Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

o

The operand stack holds operands for the instructions and receives their results. Arguments
are pushed onto the stack top or popped off the stack top. The top element always has
address 0; the one below it has address 1, and so on. Stack addresses are not used except as a
specification mechanism.

o

The scope stack is part of the run-time environment and holds objects that are to be searched
by the AVM2 when an instruction is executed that calls for name lookup. Instructions push
elements onto the scope stack as part of the implementation of exception handling, closure
creation, and for the ActionScript 3.0 with statement.

o

The local registers hold parameter values, local variables in some cases, and temporaries.



The constant pool holds constant values that are referenced, ultimately, by the instruction stream:
numbers, strings, and various kinds of names.



Instructions and the AVM2 can create new objects at run-time, and these objects are allocated in the
heap. The only way to access the heap is through an object allocated in it. Objects in the heap that
are no longer needed will eventually be reclaimed by the AVM2.



The run-time environment logically consists of a chain of objects, and named properties on these
objects are the locations found during a name lookup at run-time. Name lookup proceeds from the
innermost (most recently pushed) scope toward the outermost (global) scope.
The creation of a method closure causes the run-time environment that is current at the time of
creation to be captured in the closure; when the closure is later invoked, that scope is made current,
and will be extended by the code in the method body.

2.3 Names
Names in the AVM are represented by a combination of an unqualified name and one or more namespaces.
These are collectively called multinames. Multiname entries usually consist of a name index, and a namespace or
namespace set index. Some multinames can have the name and/or namespace part resolved at runtime. There
are a number of different types of multinames as described below. Properties of objects are always named by a
simple QName (a pair of name and namespace). The other types of multinames are used to resolve properties
at runtime.
RTQName, RTQNameL, and MultinameL are collectively referred to as runtime multinames.

2.3.1 QName (Qualified Name)
This is the simplest form of a multiname. It is a name with exactly one namespace, hence QName for qualified
name. QName entries will have a name index followed by a namespace index. The name index is an index into
the string constant pool, and the namespace index is an index into the namespace constant pool.
QNames are typically used to represent the names of variables, and for type annotations.
public var s : String;

This code will produce two QName entries, one for the variable s (public namespace, name "s") and one for the
type String (public namespace, name "String").

2.3.2 RTQName (Runtime Qualified Name)
This is a runtime QName, where the namespace is not resolved until runtime. RTQName entries will have
only a name index, which is an index into the string constant pool. The namespace is determined at runtime.
When a RTQName is an operand to an opcode, there should be a namespace value on the stack the
Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

RTQName should use. So when the RTQName is used, the top value of the stack will be popped off, and the
RTQName will use that as its namespace.
RTQNames are typically used for qualified names when the namespace is not known at compile time.
var ns = getANamespace();
x = ns::r;

This code will produce a RTQName entry for ns::r. It will have a name of "r" and code will be generated to
push the value of ns onto the stack.

2.3.3 RTQNameL (Runtime Qualified Name Late)
This is a runtime QName, where both the name and namespace are resolved at runtime. When a RTQNameL
is an operand to an opcode there will be a name and a namespace value on the stack. The name value on the
stack must be of type String, and the namespace value on the stack must be of type Namespace.
RTQNameLs are typically used for qualified names when neither the name, nor the qualifier is known at
compile time.
var x = getAName();
var ns = getANamespace();
w = ns::[x];

This code will produce a RTQNameL entry in the constant pool for ns::[x]. It has neither a name nor a
namespace, but code will be generated to push the value of ns and x onto the stack.

2.3.4 Multiname (Multiple Namespace Name)
This is a multiname with a name and a namespace set. The namespace set is used to represent a collection of
namespaces. Multiname entries will have a name index followed by a namespace set index. The name index is
an index into the string constant pool, and the namespace set index is an index into the namespace set constant
pool.
Multinames are typically used for unqualified names. In these cases all open namespaces are used for the
multiname.
use namespace t;
trace(f);

This code will produce a multiname entry for f. It will have a name of "f" and a namespace set for all the open
namespaces (the public namespace, the namespace t, and any private or internal namespaces open in that
context). At runtime f could be resolved in any of the namespaces specified by the multiname.

2.3.5 MultinameL (Multiple Namespace Name Late)
This is a runtime multiname where the name is resolved at runtime. The namespace set is used to represent a
collection of namespaces. MultinameL entries have a namespace set index. The namespace set index is an index
into the namespace set constant pool. When a MultinameL is an operand to an opcode there will be a name
value on the stack. The name value on the stack must be of type String.
MultinameLs are typically used for unqualified names where the name is not known at compile time.

Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

9

use namespace t;
trace(o[x]);

This code will produce a MultinameL entry. It will have no name, and will have a namespace set for all the
open namespaces in that context. Code will be generated to push the value of x onto the stack, and that value
will be used as the name.

2.3.6 Resolving multinames
Typically, the order of the search for resolving multinames is the object’s declared traits, its dynamic properties,
and finally the prototype chain. 2 The dynamic properties and prototype chain search will only happen if the
multiname contains the public namespace (dynamic properties are always in the public namespace in
ActionScript 3.0; a run-time error is signaled if an attempt is add a non-public property). If a search does not
include one or more of these locations, it is noted in the text in the following chapters. Otherwise, you can
assume that all three are searched in this order to resolve a multiname.
If the multiname is any type of QName, then the QName will resolve to the property with the same name and
namespace as the QName. If no property has the same name and namespace as the QName, the QName is
unresolved on that object.
If the multiname has a namespace set, then the object is searched for any properties whose name is the same as
the multinames name, and whose namespace matches any of the namespaces in the multinames namespace set.
Since the multiname may have more than one namespace, there could be multiple properties that match the
multiname. If there are multiple properties that match a TypeError is raised since it is ambiguous which
property the multiname is referring to. If no properties match, then the multiname is unresolved on that object.

2.4 Method invocation notes
When invoking a method in the AVM2, the first argument is always the “this” value to be used in the method.
All methods take at least 1 argument (the “this” value), followed by any declared arguments.
When invoking the [[Call]] property, the behavior is different for different types of closures. A closure is an
object that contains a reference to a method, and the [[Call]] property acts differently depending on whether it
is a function, method, or class closure. A function closure is one that is of a global method that isn‘t associated
with any instance of a class. A method closure contains an instance method of a class, and will always remember
its original “this” value.
function f(){}
var a = f; // a is a function closure
class C{
function m(){}
}
var q = new C();
var a = q.m; // a is a method closure

If the closure is a function closure, then the first argument passed to [[Call]] is passed on to the method and
gets used as the “this” value. If the first argument is null or undefined, then the global object will be used as
the “this” value for the method.
2

ECMAScript 3 supports prototyped-based inheritance. See ECMA 262 section 4.2.1 for a description of
the prototype chain.

Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

10

If the closure is a method closure, then the first argument of [[Call]] will be ignored, and the saved “this” value
for the method closure will be passed to the method as the first argument. A method closure records what its
original “this” value was and always uses that instead of the first argument to [[Call]].
If the closure is a class closure, and there is 1 argument passed to [[Call]] (in addition to the “this” argument),
then the call is treated as a type conversion, and the argument will be coerced to the type represented by the
closure.

2.5 Instruction set summary
This section provides an overview of the AVM2 instruction set. By convention, instructions specific to a
specific data type are named with a suffix which indicates the data type on which it operates. Specifically, the
following suffixes are used: _b (Boolean), _a (any), _i (int), _d (double), _s (string), _u (unsigned), and _o
(object).

2.5.1 Load and store instructions
Local registers can be accessed using the following instructions: getlocal, getlocal0, getlocal1, getlocal2,
getlocal3, setlocal, setlocal0, setlocal1, setlocal2, setlocal3.

2.5.2 Arithmetic instructions
The arithmetic instructions provide a full repertoire of mathematical operations. Zero, one, or more typically
two operands are removed from the top of the stack and the result of the operation is pushed back onto the
operand stack.
Addition is performed using one the following: increment, increment_i, inclocal, inclocal_i, add,
add_i.
Subtraction is accomplished using the following: decrement, decrement_i, declocal, declocal_i,
subtract, subtract_i.
Multiplication and division are achieved with multiply, multiply_i, divide, and modulo.
In order to reverse the sign of a value, the negate or negate_i instruction can be used.
There also exists a set of instructions that perform value comparisons on the top two entries on the stack
replacing them with a true or false value. These include equals, strictequals, lessthan, lessequals,
greaterthan, greaterequals, istype, istypelate, and in.

2.5.3 Bit manipulation instructions
Instructions that allow the bits of a value to be manipulated include bitnot, bitand, bitor, bitxor, lshift,
rshift, urshift.
Prior to executing these instructions, the value to be operated upon is converted to an integer, if necessary.

2.5.4 Type conversion instructions
The ActionScript language is a loosely typed language where objects are freely converted into whatever types are
necessary in order to complete an operation. In some cases explicit conversion is required and for those
instances the coerce instructions are provided. These include coerce, convert_b, coerce_a, convert_i,
convert_d, coerce_s, convert_s, convert_u, and convert_o.

Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

11

2.5.5 Object creation and manipulation instructions
Entities are created by using one of the following instructions: newclass, newobject, newarray,
newactivation.
In order to invoke an object’s constructor the instructions construct, constructsuper, and constructprop
are used.
Namespaces can be constructed dynamically using dxns and dxnslate.

2.5.6 Stack management instructions
A number of instructions provide direct access to manipulate values placed on the stack. Instructions that push
a value directly include pushnull, pushundefined, pushtrue, pushfalse, pushnan, pushbyte, pushshort,
pushstring, pushint, pushdouble, pushscope, and pushnamespace.
A value can be removed from the stack by using pop, while dup duplicates the value at the top of the stack, and
similarly swap exchanges the top two values on the stack.

2.5.7 Control transfer instructions
The control transfer instructions transfer execution to an instruction other than the one immediately following
the transfer instruction. The transfer can be unconditional or based upon a comparison operation that is
implicit with the instruction.
The conditional branches instructions include iflt, ifle, ifnlt, ifnle, ifgt, ifge, ifngt, ifnge, ifeq,
ifne, ifstricteq, ifstrictne, iftrue, and iffalse. These instructions perform any necessary type
conversions in order to implement the compare; the conversion rules are outlined in ECMA-262.
The label instruction is used to mark the target position of backwards branch instruction. Thus the target
location of every backwards branch instruction should land on a label instruction.
The lookupswitch instruction provides a compact form for encoding a multi-way compare expression.

2.5.8 Function invocation and return instructions
There are a number of instructions to invoke functions and methods. The call instruction implements a fully
compliant rendition of Function.prototype.call of the ECMA-262 specification. To invoke object instance
methods the callmethod instruction is utilized. Likewise for calling class, also known as static methods,
callstatic exists. In order to invoke instance methods not on an object, but on its base class, callsuper is
used. For named elements which are invoked as a method and for which the ActionScript compiler can validate
the usage as such, callproperty and callproplex are available. The latter is for the case when the object for
which the property being invoked exists on the stack.
For cases in which the return value of the call is never used, callpropvoid and callsupervoid can be used in
place of callproperty and callsuper, respectively.

2.5.9 Exception instructions
An exception is thrown programmatically using the throw instruction. Exceptions can also be thrown by
various AVM instructions when an abnormal condition is encountered.
The try/catch statement in the ActionScript language is translated into a table of intervals, and target
instructions that are specified in the method body portion of the abc file. The table defines a range of
instructions over which a given exception type may be caught. Thus if during the execution of a given set of
instructions an exception is thrown and there is an associated entry in the exception table, program execution
will continue at the target instruction specified in the table.

2.5.10 Debugging instructions
Unlike many traditional execution environments the debugging facilities of the AVM2 are tightly intertwined
with a series of instructions that are placed directly in the execution stream. To track current file name and line
number information debugfile and debugline are emitted at appropriate points in the instruction stream. In
cases where additional debugging detail is required, the debug instruction is used. For example, the names of
local variables are provided by this mechanism.

Loading, linking, verification, and execution

3.1

Overview

An ABC file is processed by the AVM2 in four logical phases, known as loading, linking, verification, and
execution. These phases overlap and, in particular, verification overlaps with all of the other phases.
During loading, the ABC file is read into memory and decoded. For example, the constant pool is transformed
to an in-memory data structure using different encodings. Verification at this stage is relative to the structure
of the ABC file, which must conform to the definitions presented in the next chapter.
During linking, some names referenced from individual fields of the ABC file structure are resolved, and the
resulting objects are linked together into a more complex data structure. For example, a class definition’s “base
class” field names the base class; resolving that name finds the definition of the base class, and a final class
object for the derived class is created based on information from the two definition objects. Verification at this
stage is relative to this web of objects: the names mentioned must resolve; the resulting traits sets must be
coherent; and so on.
During execution, the bytecodes representing compiled code in the ABC file are run through an interpreter,
thus performing computation. Verification at this stage is relative to the stream of instructions and the
contents of the execution stack: instructions must not jump outside the bytecode array; instructions that require
certain operand types can be applied only to operands whose known type is the correct one; the code must not
use more stack and register space than it has reserved; and so on.
When verification fails during any of these phases, the AVM2 throws a VerifyError. VerifyErrors thrown
during execution can be caught by the program.
The AVM2 interleaves linking with both loading and execution. When linking is performed during loading,
forward references are precluded; for example, class definitions can only reference previously defined classes as
base classes. In contrast, when linking is performed during execution, some references to undefined entities
may not be flagged as errors; for example, a method that uses the name of a type that hasn’t been defined may
not cause a VerifyError to be thrown provided the method isn’t invoked.

3.2 Loading and linking
During the loading and linking phase, the following steps occur. (Note that a fair amount of linking is deferred
until the execution phase.)
•

Each ABC file is loaded into memory and decoded. This initial decoding verifies that the ABC file
has the correct structure and that the fields that matter at this stage contain valid references to other
parts of the ABC file.

•

Trait objects are created for classes and scripts.

•

Subclass/superclass relationships are resolved. The trait set of each class’s superclass is merged into the
trait set for the class, and interfaces in the class’s interface set are looked up. Early resolution ensures
that the inheritance graph is a tree.

•

The constant pool is constructed. Each reference to another element of the constant pool is resolved
(it must be in range for the correct type).

•

Method bodies are linked with their method information (signature) structures.

3.3 Execution
This section describes the state of the virtual machine as it is observed by the executing bytecode.

3.3.1 Program invocation and exit
One of the entries in the ABC file is an array of script_info entries (see the next chapter). Each of these
entries contains a reference to an initialization method for the script and a set of traits to be defined in the
script’s environment. The last entry in that array is the entry point for the ABC file; that is, the last entry’s
initialization method contains the first bytecode that’s run when the ABC file is executed.
The other scripts’ initialization blocks are run on demand, when entities exported from those scripts are first
referenced by the program during property lookup.
As far as the virtual machine is concerned, the initialization blocks are normal methods, and they should signal
normal termination by executing one of the return instructions (OP_returnvalue, OP_returnvoid). The
value returned by a script is ignored.

3.3.2 Class initialization
The class’s static initializer will be run when the newclass instruction is executed on the class_info entry for
the class.

3.3.3 Method entry
When a method body is first entered, its execution environment is set up in a particular way. In the following
discussion, method_info and method_body_info refer to structures defined in the next chapter.
When control enters a method, three local data areas are allocated for it, as outlined in Chapter 2—an operand
stack segment, a scope stack segment, and a set of local registers. The operand stack segment holds operands to
the instructions; values are pushed onto that stack or popped off it by most instructions. The scope stack
segments holds scope objects in which the virtual machine will look up names at execution time. Objects are
pushed onto the scope stack by OP_pushscope and OP_pushwith, and popped off by OP_popscope and by the
exception handling machinery. The local registers hold parameter values, local variables, and temporaries.
On method entry, the state of these data areas is as follows.
•

The operand stack is empty and has room for method_body_info.max_stack values.

•

The scope stack is empty and has room for method_body_info.max_scope_stack values.

•

There are method_body_info.local_count registers.

•

Register 0 holds the “this” object. This value is never null.

•

Registers 1 through method_info.param_count holds parameter values coerced to the declared types
of the parameters. If fewer than method_body_info.local_count values are supplied to the call then
the remaining values are either the values provided by default value declarations (optional arguments)
or the value undefined.

•

If NEED_REST is set in method_info.flags, the method_info.param_count+1 register is set up to
reference an array that holds the superflous arguments.

•

If NEED_ARGUMENTS is set in method_info.flags, the method_info.param_count+1 register is set up
to reference an “arguments” object that holds all the actual arguments: see ECMA-262 for more
information. (The AVM2 is not strictly compatible with ECMA-262; it creates an Array object for
the “arguments” object, whereas ECMA-262 requires a plain Object.)

3.3.4 Execution mechanics
Execution begins with the first instruction of the code in the method_body_info. The address of this first
instruction is 0. The first byte of each instruction is the opcode, which is followed by zero or more bytes of
operands. The instruction may modify the local data areas as well as objects on the heap, and it may create new
objects on the heap either directly or indirectly. (The AVM2 instruction set is defined in Section 2.5.)
Branch and jump instructions add a signed offset to the program counter to effectuate the branch. The base
value for the program counter is the instruction address following the instruction.

3.3.5 Calling and returning
When one of the call instructions is executed, a new local data area is created for the called function. The called
function has no access to the local data area of its caller. The actual parameter values are coerced to the types
expected by the called function as part of the call protocol.
The return instructions transfer a single value from the returning function’s stack, or the implied value
undefined, to the caller. The returned value is coerced to the returning function’s declared return type as part
of the return protocol. The coerced value replaces the operands of the call instruction in the calling method’s
stack, and the called method’s local data area is destroyed.

3.3.6 Exception handling
Exception handlers are defined by a table associated with each method. The table defines a range of bytecode
addresses across which a particular handler is active, the bytecode address of the handler, and a type which is
used to determine whether the handler will handle a particular exception.
When an exception is thrown, the call stack is unwound until a method is found that contains a handler which
covers the current program counter and whose type is a supertype of the type of the object thrown. The
method containing the handler is reactivated and the program counter is set to point to the first address of the
handler. The value and scope stacks in the handling method are cleared before the handler is entered.
A finally clause is normally translated as an exception handler that accepts any type of value, which it catches
and rethrows after the body of the finally block finishes executing.

3.4 Verification
As noted earlier, verification does not happen all at once. Verification is often put off until a datum is actually
needed or until some dependent object has been loaded, so that forward references will be possible.
The following list summarizes some of the verification errors signaled by the AVM2. (Not all verification errors
are listed.)
•

There must be no nonzero bits above bit 30 in a u30 value.

•

No control flow instruction must cause control to be transferred outside the code vector or into the
middle of another instruction.

•

Multiple control flow instructions to the same instruction must have compatible scope stacks, operand
stacks, and register values.

•

Named types (for example, in coerce instructions or in a base class reference) must always be
uniquely resolvable.

•

Names may not reference index zero of the name pool unless explicitly specified for that particular
name field.

Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

16

•

Some name fields (for example, instance_info) require the referenced name to be a QName.

•

A class cannot subclass a final class or an interface.

•

The interface set of a class cannot reference interface zero, and must reference interfaces (not classes).

•

Method indices for callmethod and callstatic must provably be within the range of the receiver
object’s method table.

•

When an instruction definition section contains wording along the lines of “<value> must be less than
<constraint>”, this usually implies a static constraint that is checked by the verifier.

The ActionScript Byte Code (abc) format

Syntactically complete sections of ActionScript code are processed by a compiler into ActionScript Byte Code
segments. These segments are described by the abcFile structure, which is defined below. The abcFile
structure is the unit of loading and execution used by the AVM2.
The abcFile structure describes the interpretation of a block of 8-bit bytes. Despite the name, the contents of
an abcFile does not need to be read from a file in the file system; it can be generated dynamically by a runtime compiler or other tools. The use of the word “file” is historical.
The abcFile structure comprises primitive data, structured data, and arrays of primitive and structured data.
The following sections describe all the data formats.
Primitive data include integers and floating-point numbers encoded in various ways.
Structured data, including the abcFile itself, are presented here using a C-like structural notation, with
individual named fields. Fields within this structure are in reality just sequences of bytes that are interpreted
according to their type. The fields are stored sequentially without any padding or alignment.

4.1

Primitive data types

Multi-byte primitive data are stored in little-endian order (less significant bytes precede more significant bytes).
Negative integers are represented using two’s complement.


The type u8 represents a one-byte unsigned integer value.



The type u16 represents a two-byte unsigned integer value.



The type s24 represents a three-byte signed integer value.



The type u30 represents a variable-length encoded 30-bit unsigned integer value.



The types u32 and s32 represent variable-length encoded 32-bit unsigned and signed integer values
respectively.



The type d64 defines an 8-byte IEEE-754 floating point value. The high byte of the double value
contains the sign and upper bits of the exponent, and the low byte contains the least significant bits of
the significand.

The variable-length encoding for u30, u32, and s32 uses one to five bytes, depending on the magnitude of the
value encoded. Each byte contributes its low seven bits to the value. If the high (eighth) bit of a byte is set,
then the next byte of the abcFile is also part of the value. In the case of s32, sign extension is applied: the
seventh bit of the last byte of the encoding is propagated to fill out the 32 bits of the decoded value.

u30 method_body_count
method_body_info method_body[method_body_count]
}

The abcFile structure describes an executable code block with all its constant data, type descriptors, code, and
metadata. It comprises the following fields.
minor_version, major_version
The values of major_version and minor_version are the major and minor version numbers of the
abcFile format. A change in the minor version number signifies a change in the file format that is

backward compatible, in the sense that an implementation of the AVM2 can still make use of a file of an
older version. A change in the major version number denotes an incompatible adjustment to the file
format.
As of the publication of this overview, the major version is 46 and the minor version is 16.
constant_pool
The constant_pool is a variable length structure composed of integers, doubles, strings, namespaces,

namespace sets, and multinames. These constants are referenced from other parts of the abcFile
structure.
method_count, method
The value of method_count is the number of entries in the method array.

Each entry in the method array
is a variable length method_info structure. The array holds information about every method defined in
this abcFile. The code for method bodies is held separately in the method_body array (see below).
Some entries in method may have no body—this is the case for native methods, for example.

metadata_count, metadata
The value of metadata_count is the number of entries in the metadata array. Each metadata entry is a
metadata_info structure that maps a name to a set of string values.
class_count, instance, class
The value of class_count is the number of entries in the instance and class arrays.

Each instance entry is a variable length instance_info structure which specifies the characteristics of
object instances created by a particular class.
Each class entry defines the characteristics of a class. It is used in conjunction with the instance field to
derive a full description of an AS Class.
script_count, script
The value of script_count is the number of entries in the script array. Each script entry is a
script_info structure that defines the characteristics of a single script in this file. As explained in the

previous chapter, the last entry in this array is the entry point for execution in the abcFile.
Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

19

method_body_count, method_body
The value of method_body_count is the number of entries in the method_body array. Each method_body

entry consists of a variable length method_body_info structure which contains the instructions for an
individual method or function.

4.3 Constant pool
The constant pool is a block of array-based entries that reflect the constants used by all methods. Each of the
count entries (for example, int_count) must be one more than the number of entries in the corresponding
array, and the first entry in the array is element “1”. For all constant pools, the index “0” has a special meaning,
typically a sensible default value. For example, the “0” entry is used to represent the empty sting (""), the any
namespace, or the any type (*) depending on the context it is used in. When “0” has a special meaning it is
described in the text below.
cpool_info
{
u30 int_count
s32 integer[int_count]
u30 uint_count
u32 uinteger[uint_count]
u30 double_count
d64 double[double_count]
u30 string_count
string_info string[string_count]
u30 namespace_count
namespace_info namespace[namespace_count]
u30 ns_set_count
ns_set_info ns_set[ns_set_count]
u30 multiname_count
multiname_info multiname[multiname_count]
}

If there is more than one entry in one of these arrays for the same entity, such as a name, the AVM may or may
not consider those two entries to mean the same thing. The AVM currently guarantees that names flagged as
belonging to the “private” namespace are treated as unique.
int_count, integer

The value of int_count is the number of entries in the integer array, plus one. The integer array
holds integer constants referenced by the bytecode. The “0” entry of the integer array is not present in
the abcFile; it represents the zero value for the purposes of providing values for optional parameters and
field initialization.
uint_count, uinteger

The value of uint_count is the number of entries in the uinteger array, plus one. The uinteger array
holds unsigned integer constants referenced by the bytecode. The “0” entry of the uinteger array is not
present in the abcFile; it represents the zero value for the purposes of providing values for optional
parameters and field initialization.
double_count, double

The value of double_count is the number of entries in the double array, plus one. The double array
holds IEEE double-precision floating point constants referenced by the bytecode. The “0” entry of the
double array is not present in the abcFile; it represents the NaN (Not-a-Number) value for the purposes
of providing values for optional parameters and field initialization.

Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

20

string_count, string

The value of string_count is the number of entries in the string array, plus one. The string array
holds UTF-8 encoded strings referenced by the compiled code and by many other parts of the abcFile.
In addition to describing string constants in programs, string data in the constant pool are used in the
description of names of many kinds. Entry “0” of the string array is not present in the abcFile; it
represents the empty string in most contexts but is also used to represent the “any” name in others
(known as “*” in ActionScript).
namespace_count, namespace

The value of namespace_count is the number of entries in the namespace array, plus one. The
namespace array describes the namespaces used by the bytecode and also for names of many kinds. Entry
“0” of the namespace array is not present in the abcFile; it represents the “any” namespace (known as
“*” in ActionScript).
ns_set_count, ns_set

The value of ns_set_count is the number of entries in the ns_set array, plus one. The ns_set array
describes namespace sets used in the descriptions of multinames. The “0” entry of the ns_set array is not
present in the abcFile.
multiname_count, multiname

The value of multiname_count is the number of entries in the multiname array, plus one. The
multiname array describes names used by the bytecode. The “0” entry of the multiname array is not
present in the abcFile.

4.4

String

A string_info element encodes a string of 16-bit characters on a length-and-data format. The meaning of
each character is normally taken to be that of a Unicode 16-bit code point. The data are UTF-8 encoded. For
more information on Unicode, see unicode.org.
string_info
{
u30 size
u8 utf8[size]
}

Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

21

4.4.1 Namespace
A namespace_info entry defines a namespace. Namespaces have string names, represented by indices into the
string array, and kinds. User-defined namespaces have kind CONSTANT_Namespace or
CONSTANT_ExplicitNamespace and a non-empty name. System namespaces have empty names and one of the
other kinds, and provides a means for the loader to map references to these namespaces onto internal entities.
namespace_info
{
u8 kind
u30 name
}

A single byte defines the type of entry that follows, thus identifying how the name field should be interpreted by
the loader. The name field is an index into the string section of the constant pool. A value of zero denotes an
empty string. The table below lists the legal values for kind.

4.4.2 Namespace set
An ns_set_info entry defines a set of namespaces, allowing the set to be used as a unit in the definition of
multinames.
ns_set_info
{
u30 count
u30 ns[count]
}

The count field defines how many ns’s are identified for the entry, while each ns is an integer that indexes into
the namespace array of the constant pool. No entry in the ns array may be zero.

Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

22

4.4.3 Multiname
A multiname_info entry is a variable length item that is used to define multiname entities used by the
bytecode. There are many kinds of multinames. The kind field acts as a tag: its value determines how the
loader should see the variable-length data field. The layout of the contents of the data field under a particular
kind is described below by the multiname_kind_ structures.

Those constants ending in “A” (such as CONSTANT_QNameA) represent the names of attributes.

QName
The multiname_kind_QName format is used for kinds CONSTANT_QName and CONSTANT_QNameA.
multiname_kind_QName
{
u30 ns
u30 name
}

The ns and name fields are indexes into the namespace and string arrays of the constant_pool entry,
respectively. A value of zero for the ns field indicates the any (“*”) namespace, and a value of zero for the name
field indicates the any (“*”) name.

RTQName
The multiname_kind_RTQName format is used for kinds CONSTANT_RTQName and CONSTANT_RTQNameA.
multiname_kind_RTQName
{
u30 name
}

The single field, name, is an index into the string array of the constant pool. A value of zero indicates the any
(“*”) name.

Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

23

RTQNameL
The multiname_kind_RTQNameL format is used for kinds CONSTANT_RTQNameL and CONSTANT_RTQNameLA.
multiname_kind_RTQNameL
{
}

This kind has no associated data.

Multiname
The multiname_kind_Multiname format is used for kinds CONSTANT_Multiname and CONSTANT_MultinameA.
multiname_kind_Multiname
{
u30 name
u30 ns_set
}

The name field is an index into the string array, and the ns_set field is an index into the ns_set array. A
value of zero for the name field indicates the any (“*”) name. The value of ns_set cannot be zero.

MultinameL
The multiname_kind_MultinameL format is used for kinds CONSTANT_MultinameL and
CONSTANT_MultinameLA.
multiname_kind_MultinameL
{
u30 ns_set
}

The ns_set field is an index into the ns_set array of the constant pool. The value of ns_set cannot be zero.

4.5 Method signature
The method_info entry defines the signature of a single method.
method_info
{
u30 param_count
u30 return_type
u30 param_type[param_count]
u30 name
u8 flags
option_info options
param_info param_names
}

The fields are as follows:
param_count, param_type

The param_count field is the number of formal parameters that the method supports; it also represents
the length of the param_type array. Each entry in the param_type array is an index into the multiname
Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

24

array of the constant pool; the name at that entry provides the name of the type of the corresponding
formal parameter. A zero value denotes the any (“*”) type.
return_type

The return_type field is an index into the multiname array of the constant pool; the name at that entry
provides the name of the return type of this method. A zero value denotes the any (“*”) type.
name

The name field is an index into the string array of the constant pool; the string at that entry provides the
name of this method. If the index is zero, this method has no name.
flags

The flag field is a bit vector that provides additional information about the method. The bits are
described by the following table. (Bits not described in the table should all be set to zero.)
Name
NEED_ARGUMENTS

Value
0x01

Meaning

NEED_ACTIVATION

0x02

Must be set if this method uses the newactivation opcode.

NEED_REST

0x04

This flag creates an ActionScript 3.0 rest arguments array. Must not be
used with NEED_ARGUMENTS. See Chapter 3.

HAS_OPTIONAL

0x08

Must be set if this method has optional parameters and the options
field is present in this method_info structure.

SET_DXNS

0x40

Must be set if this method uses the dxns or dxnslate opcodes.

HAS_PARAM_NAMES

0x80

Must be set when the param_names field is present in this method_info
structure.

Suggests to the run-time that an “arguments” object (as specified by the
ActionScript 3.0 Language Reference) be created. Must not be used
together with NEED_REST. See Chapter 3.

options

This entry may be present only if the HAS_OPTIONAL flag is set in flags.
param_names

This entry may be present only if the HAS_PARAM_NAMES flag is set in flags.

4.5.1 Optional parameters
The option_info entry is used to define the default values for the optional parameters of the method. The
number of optional parameters is given by option_count, which must not be zero nor greater than the
parameter_count field of the enclosing method_info structure.
option_info
{
u30 option_count
option_detail option[option_count]
}

option_detail
{
u30 val
u8 kind
}
Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

25

Each optional value consists of a kind field that denotes the type of value represented, and a val field that is an
index into one of the array entries of the constant pool. The correct array is selected based on the kind.

4.5.2 Parameter names
The param_names entry is available only when the HAS_PARAM_NAMES bit is set in the flags. Each param_info
element of the array is an index into the constant pool’s string array. The parameter name entry exists solely
for external tool use and is not used by the AVM2.
param_info
{
u30 param_name[param_count]
}

4.6 metadata_info
The metadata_info entry provides a means of embedding arbitrary key /value pairs into the ABC file. The
AVM2 will ignore all such entries.
metadata_info
{
u30 name
u30 item_count
item_info items[item_count]
}

The name field is an index into the string array of the constant pool; it provides a name for the metadata
entry. The value of the name field must not be zero. Zero or more items may be associated with the entry;
item_count denotes the number of items that follow in the items array.
item_info
{
u30 key
u30 value
}

The item_info entry consists of item_count elements that are interpreted as key/value pairs of indices into the
string table of the constant pool. If the value of key is zero, this is a keyless entry and only carries a value.

Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

27

4.7 Instance
The instance_info entry is used to define the characteristics of a run-time object (a class instance) within the
AVM2. The corresponding class_info entry is used in order to fully define an ActionScript 3.0 Class.
instance_info
{
u30 name
u30 super_name
u8 flags
u30 protectedNs
u30 intrf_count
u30 interface[intrf_count]
u30 iinit
u30 trait_count
traits_info trait[trait_count]
}
name

The name field is an index into the multiname array of the constant pool; it provides a name for the
class. The entry specified must be a QName.
super_name

The super_name field is an index into the multiname array of the constant pool; it provides the name of
the base class of this class, if any. A value of zero indicates that this class has no base class.
flags

The flags field is used to identify various options when interpreting the instance_info entry. It is bit
vector; the following entries are defined. Other bits must be zero.
Name
CONSTANT_ClassSealed

Value
0x01

Meaning

CONSTANT_ClassFinal

0x02

The class is final: it cannot be a base class for any other
class.

CONSTANT_ClassInterface

0x04

The class is an interface.

CONSTANT_ClassProtectedNs

0x08

The class uses its protected namespace and the
protectedNs field is present in the interface_info
structure.

The class is sealed: properties can not be dynamically added
to instances of the class.

protectedNs

This field is present only if the CONSTANT_ProtectedNs bit of flags is set. It is an index into the
namespace array of the constant pool and identifies the namespace that serves as the protected namespace
for this class.
intrf_count, interface

The value of the intrf_count field is the number of entries in the interface array. The interface array
contains indices into the multiname array of the constant pool; the referenced names specify the interfaces
implemented by this class. None of the indices may be zero.

Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

28

iinit

This is an index into the method array of the abcFile; it references the method that is invoked whenever
an object of this class is constructed. This method is sometimes referred to as an instance initializer.
trait_count, trait

The value of trait_count is the number of elements in the trait array. The trait array defines the set
of traits of a class instance. The next section defines the meaning of the traits_info structure.

4.8 Trait
A trait is a fixed property of an object or class; it has a name, a type, and some associated data. The
traits_info structure bundles these data.
traits_info
{
u30 name
u8 kind
u8 data[]
u30 metadata_count
u30 metadata[metadata_count]
}
name

The name field is an index into the multiname array of the constant pool; it provides a name for the trait.
The value can not be zero, and the multiname entry specified must be a QName.
kind

The kind field contains two four-bit fields. The lower four bits determine the kind of this trait. The
upper four bits comprise a bit vector providing attributes of the trait. See the following tables and
sections for full descriptions.
data

The interpretation of the data field depends on the type of the trait, which is provided by the low four
bits of the kind field. See below for a full description.
metadata_count, metadata

These fields are present only if ATTR_Metadata is present in the upper four bits of the kind field.
The value of the metadata_count field is the number of entries in the metadata array. That array
contains indices into the metadata array of the abcFile.

4.8.1 Summary of trait types
The following table summarizes the trait types.

Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

29

4.8.2 Slot and const traits
A kind value of Trait_Slot (0) or Trait_Const (6) requires that the data field be read using trait_slot,
which takes the following form:
trait_slot
{
u30 slot_id
u30 type_name
u30 vindex
u8 vkind
}
slot_id

The slot_id field is an integer from 0 to N and is used to identify a position in which this trait resides. A
value of 0 requests the AVM2 to assign a position.
type_name

This field is used to identify the type of the trait. It is an index into the multiname array of the
constant_pool. A value of zero indicates that the type is the any type (*).
vindex

This field is an index that is used in conjunction with the vkind field in order to define a value for the
trait. If it is 0, vkind is empty; otherwise it references one of the tables in the constant pool, depending on
the value of vkind.
vkind

This field exists only when vindex is non-zero. It is used to determine how vindex will be interpreted.
See the “Constant Kind” table above for details.

4.8.3 Class traits
A kind value of Trait_Class (0x04) implies that the trait_class entry should be used.
trait_class
{
u30 slot_id
u30 classi
}
slot_id

The slot_id field is an integer from 0 to N and is used to identify a position in which this trait resides. A
value of 0 requests the AVM2 to assign a position.
class

The classi field is an index that points into the class array of the abcFile entry.

Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

30

4.8.4 Function traits
A kind value of Trait_Function (0x05) implies that the trait_function entry should be used.
trait_function
{
u30 slot_id
u30 function
}
slot_id

The slot_id field is an integer from 0 to N and is used to identify a position in which this trait resides.
A value of 0 requests the AVM2 to assign a position.
function

The function field is an index that points into the method array of the abcFile entry.

4.8.5 Method, getter, and setter traits
A kind value of Trait_Method (0x01), Trait_Getter (0x02) or Trait_Setter (0x03) implies that the
trait_method entry should be used.
trait_method
{
u30 disp_id
u30 method
}
disp_id

The disp_id field is a compiler assigned integer that is used by the AVM2 to optimize the resolution of
virtual function calls. An overridden method must have the same disp_id as that of the method in the
base class. A value of zero disables this optimization.
method

The method field is an index that points into the method array of the abcFile entry.

4.8.6 Trait attributes
As previously mentioned the upper nibble of the kind field is used to encode attributes. A description of how
the attributes are interpreted for each kind is outlined below. Any other combination of attribute with kind
is ignored.

Attributes

Value

ATTR_Final

0x1

Is used with Trait_Method, Trait_Getter and Trait_Setter. It marks a
method that cannot be overridden by a sub-class

ATTR_Override

0x2

Is used with Trait_Method, Trait_Getter and Trait_Setter. It marks a
method that has been overridden in this class

ATTR_Metadata

0x4

Is used to signal that the fields metadata_count and metadata follow the
data field in the traits_info entry

4.9 Class
The class_info entry is used to define characteristics of an ActionScript 3.0 class.
Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

31

class_info
{
u30 cinit
u30 trait_count
traits_info traits[trait_count]
}
cinit

This is an index into the method array of the abcFile; it references the method that is invoked when the
class is first created. This method is also known as the static initializer for the class.
trait_count, trait

The value of trait_count is the number of entries in the trait array. The trait array holds the traits
for the class (see above for information on traits).

4.10 Script
The script_info entry is used to define characteristics of an ActionScript 3.0 script.
script_info
{
u30 init
u30 trait_count
traits_info trait[trait_count]
}
init

The init field is an index into the method array of the abcFile. It identifies a function that is to be
invoked prior to any other code in this script.
trait_count, trait

The value of trait_count is the number of entries in the trait array. The trait array is the set of traits
defined by the script.

4.11 Method body
The method_body_info entry holds the AVM2 instructions that are associated with a particular method or
function body. Some of the fields in this entry declare the maximum amount of resources the body will
consume during execution. These declarations allow the AVM2 to anticipate the requirements of the method
without analyzing the method body prior to execution. The declarations also serve as promises about the
resource boundary within which the method has agreed to remain. 3
There can be fewer method bodies in the method_body table than than there are method signatures in the
method table—some methods have no bodies. Therefore the method_body contains a reference to the method
it belongs to, and other parts of the abcFile always reference the method table, not the method_body table.
3

Any code loaded from an untrusted source will be examined in order to verify that the code stays within
the declared limits.

u30 code_length
u8 code[code_length]
u30 exception_count
exception_info exception[exception_count]
u30 trait_count
traits_info trait[trait_count]
}
method

The method field is an index into the method array of the abcFile; it identifies the method signature with
which this body is to be associated.
max_stack

The max_stack field is maximum number of evaluation stack slots used at any point during the execution
of this body.
local_count

The local_count field is the index of the highest-numbered local register this method will use, plus one.
init_scope_depth

The init_scope_depth field defines the minimum scope depth, relative to max_scope_depth, that may
be accessed within the method.
max_scope_depth

The max_scope_depth field defines the maximum scope depth that may be accessed within the method.
The difference between max_scope_depth and init_scope_depth determines the size of the local scope
stack.
code_length, code

The value of code_length is the number of bytes in the code array. The code array holds AVM2
instructions for this method body. The AVM2 instruction set is defined in Section 2.5.
exception_count, exception

The value of exception_count is the number of elements in the exception array. The exception array
associates exception handlers with ranges of instructions within the code array (see below).
trait_count

The value of trait_count is the number of elements in the trait array. The trait array contains all
the traits for this method body (see above for more information on traits).

Adobe ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) Overview

33

4.12 Exception
The exception_info entry is used to define the range of ActionScript 3.0 instructions over which a particular
exception handler is engaged.
exception_info
{
u30 from
u30 to
u30 target
u30 exc_type
u30 var_name
}
from

The starting position in the code field from which the exception is enabled.
to

The ending position in the code field after which the exception is disabled.
target

The position in the code field to which control should jump if an exception of type exc_type is
encountered while executing instructions that lie within the region [from, to] of the code field.
exc_type

An index into the string array of the constant pool that identifies the name of the type of exception that
is to be monitored during the reign of this handler. A value of zero means the any type (“*”) and implies
that this exception handler will catch any type of exception thrown.
var_name

This index into the string array of the constant pool defines the name of the variable that is to receive
the exception object when the exception is thrown and control is transferred to target location. If the
value is zero then there is no name associated with the exception object.

AVM2 instructions

The AVM2 instruction descriptions follow the following format.

instruction name
Operation
Brief description of the instruction.
Format
A description of the instruction with any operands that appear with it in the code.
instruction
operand1
operand2
...

Forms
instruction = opcode
Stack
A description of the stack before and after the instruction is executed. The stack top is on
the right; portions marked ... are not altered by the instruction.
..., value1, value2 => ..., value3

Description
A detailed description of the instruction, including information about the effect on the stack,
information of the operands, result of the instruction, etc.
Runtime exceptions
A description of any errors that may be thrown by this instruction. A number of these
instructions may invoke operations behind the scene. For example, name resolution can fail
to find a name or it can resolve it ambiguously; value conversion can run arbitrary user code
that may fail and therefore throw exceptions. To the program it will appear as if the
instruction threw those exceptions, but they will not be noted in the description of the
instruction.

add
Operation
Add two values.
Format
add

Forms
add = 160 (0xa0)

Stack
…, value1, value2 => …, value3
Description
Pop value1 and value2 off of the stack and add them together as specified in ECMA-262 section
11.6 and as extended in ECMA-357 section 11.4. The algorithm is briefly described below.
1.

If value1 and value2 are both Numbers, then set value3 to the result of adding the two
number values. See ECMA-262 section 11.6.3 for a description of adding number values.

2.

If value1 or value2 is a String or a Date, convert both values to String using the ToString
algorithm described in ECMA-262 section 9.8. Concatenate the string value of value2 to the
string value of value1 and set value3 to the new concatenated String.

3.

If value1 and value2 are both of type XML or XMLList, construct a new XMLList object,
then call [[Append]](value1), and then [[Append]](value2). Set value3 to the new XMLList.
See ECMA-357 section 9.2.1.6 for a description of the [[Append]] method.

4.

If none of the above apply, convert value1 and value2 to primitives. This is done by calling
ToPrimitive with no hint. This results in value1_primitive and value2_primitive. If
value1_primitive or value2_primitive is a String then convert both to Strings using the
ToString algorithm (ECMA-262 section 9.8), concatenate the results, and set value3 to the
concatenated String. Otherwise convert both to Numbers using the ToNumber algorithm
(ECMA-262 section 9.3), add the results, and set value3 to the result of the addition.

Push value3 onto the stack.

Operation
Determine if the given object has any more properties.
Format
hasnext2
object_reg

Forms
hasnext2 = 50 (0x32)

Stack
…, => …, value
Description
object_reg and index_reg are uints that must be indexes to a local register. The value of the
register at position object_reg is the object that is being enumerated and is assigned to obj.
The value of the register at position index_reg must be of type int, and that value is assigned
to cur_index.
Get the index of the next property after the property located at index cur_index on object
obj. If there are no more properties on obj, then obj is set to the next object on the prototype
chain of obj, and cur_index is set to the first index of that object. If there are no more objects
on the prototype chain and there are no more properties on obj, then obj is set to null, and
cur_index is set to 0.
The register at position object_reg is set to the value of obj, and the register at position
index_reg is set to the value of cur_index.
If index is not 0, then push true. Otherwise push false.
Notes
hasnext2 works by reference. Each time it is executed it changes the values of local registers

rather than simply returning a new value. This is because the object being enumerated can
change when it is necessary to walk up the prototype chain to find more properties. This is
different from how hasnext works, though the two may seem similar due to the similar
names.

If a handler is found then the stack is cleared, the exception object is pushed onto the stack,
and then execution resumes at the instruction offset specified by the handler.
If a handler is not found, then the method exits, and the exception is rethrown in the
invoking method, at which point it is searched for an exception handler as described here.

typeof
Operation
Get the type name of a value.
Format
typeof

Forms
typeof = 149 (0x95)

Stack
…, value => …, typename
Description
Pop a value off of the stack. Determine its type name according to the type of value:
1.

undefined = "undefined"

2.

null = "object"

3.

Boolean = "Boolean"

4.

Number | int | uint = "number"

5.

String = "string"

6.

Function = "function"

7.

XML | XMLList = "xml"

8.

Object = "object"

Push typename onto the stack.

urshift
Operation
Unsigned bitwise right shift.

urshift = 167 (0xa7)

Stack
…, value1, value2 => …, value3
Description
Pop value1 and value2 off of the stack, convert value1 to an int to create value1_int and
convert value2 to a uint to create value2_uint. Right shift value1_int by the result of
value2_uint & 0x1F (leaving only the 5 least significant bits of value2_uint), and push the
result onto the stack. The right shift is unsigned and fills in missing bits with 0, resulting in
an unsigned 32-bit integer. See ECMA-262 section 11.7.3

Hints for compiler writers

The following techniques may be useful to compiler writers targeting the AVM2.

6.1

Reestablishing the scope stack following an exception

When an exception handler is entered, the scope stack established in the catching method has been cleared (see
the description of throw in the previous chapter). This is not always desired; a try..catch statement inside a
with statement requires the extended scope of the with to still be established. The way to work around the
clearing of the scope stack is for the exception handler to reestablish the scope stack by pushing the correct set
of objects onto it before executing the body of the handler. That is, in this code:
with (x) {
try {
...
}
catch (e) {
return y
}
}

the body of the catch clause needs to look something like this, assuming x is in local 0:
getlocal_0
pushwith
...
findproperty “y”
getproperty “y”
returnvalue

; set up catch scope

6.2 In-line subroutines for handling “finally”
A finally clause on a try block must be visited when control flows out of the try block (or out of the
associated catch clause). It is possible to expand the body of the finally clause in-line everywhere it needs to
be visited, but this tends to greatly increase the amount of compiled code in the program. A more reasonable
approach is to expand the finally clause once and visit it by means of the jump instruction. To have this
“subroutine” return to the point from which it was “called”, the “caller” stores a value identifying itself in a
local variable. The finally clause returns to this location by means of a lookupswitch instruction:

...
getlocal_0
lookupswitch
0 -> R1
1 -> R2

; Code following subroutine call

; Code following subroutine call
; Subroutine. Return “address” in local 0
; Body of subroutine

(This only highlights the fact that lookupswitch is a computed goto.)

6.3 Creating an environment for nested functions
ActionScript functions that are passed around as values close over their environment, including the
environment’s local variables, when they are created. Since the local registers of an activation are not captured
when the newfunction instruction is executed, the environment for non-leaf functions must be stored in
activation objects that can be captured properly. The newactivation instruction creates such an activation.
Given the source code:
function f(x) {
return function () { return x }
}

a suitable translation is along the lines of
newactivation
dup
pushscope
getlocal_o
setproperty “x”
newfunction <inner>
returnvalue

; create a new activation record
;
and save a copy
;
and extend the current scope
; get x parameter
; store x in the activation
; create a new function

where <inner> is just a reference to the method body for the nested function. Note that newfunction
captures the contents of the scope stack, but not the local registers or the operand stack.

6.4 Optimizing method dispatch
The instructions callmethod and callstatic can be used to optimize method dispatch. They require that
the method properties of the receiver object be laid out in a particular order; the compiler provides explicit nonzero offsets for the methods in the trait_method structure in the abcFile. The call instructions then call
directly through the method table offsets, avoiding the name lookup. The verifier needs to be able to determine
that the receiver object is of a type that has a method table that has a method at that offset. Usually this means
that the receiver object can only be read by the bytecode from type-annotated locations, or that the call
instruction must be preceded by a coerce instruction.
